# ProceduralGeneratingWorld
The main goal of the project is to build a procedurally generated worlds where the user will be able to influence the creation of the world by changing variables of the world creating script. The project was started because of pure boredom.
**2D ROOM BASED DUNGEON**

**Responsibilities of the classes in the project:**

**MapGenerator** - Merger - Holds outputs and inputs from room & dungeon creating classes and merging them into one room. It prints out the array\[,] that holds generated rooms onto the world.

**CreateCorridor** - Creates randomly generated corridors determined by (in future) user input variables like "number of corridors" or "likelihood of creating corridor sideways"
