- Corridor length less than MinLenghtOfCorridors - this may be coused cuz of possibility that the corridors will try spawn out of the map max size and they are cut off mid creation
- Corridors may be created near each other - this is coused cuz method that is looking for corridors near by is run only once at the start of the creation of corridor.
- Ininite loading - its coused of first definition of the startingPointAndDirection that can be defined in the way that first few blocks of the corridor will be created out of boundaries
